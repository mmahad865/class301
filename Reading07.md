## Who is Roy Fielding?
**"Roy Thomas Fielding is an American computer scientist, one of the principal authors of the HTTP specification and the originator of the Representational State Transfer architectural style."**

## Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?
**"Because they weren't designed to be used like that. When Fielding and his colleagues started building the web, being able to talk to any machine anywhere in the world was a primary concern. But most of the techniques developers later used to get computers to talk to each other didn't have those requirements. You just needed to talk to a small group of machines."**
## What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?
**s all about applying verbs to nouns. For instance, when you go to a web page, the browser does an HTTP GET on the URL you typed in and back comes a web page.**
## What does a GET do?
**requests a representation of the specified resource**
## What does a POST do?
**"If one system needs to add something to another system, it would use an HTTP verb of POST."**
## What does PUT do?
**creates a new resource or replaces a representation of the target resource with the request payload.**
## hat does PATCH do?
**applies partial modifications to a resource**
