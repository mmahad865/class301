## What is a â€˜Controlled Componentâ€™?
**component that renders form elements and controls them by keeping the form data in the component's state**
## Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why

**"n HTML, form elements such as input, textare>, and< select  typically maintain their own state and update it based on user input. In React, mutable state is typically kept in the state property of components, and only updated with setState()."**

 ## How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?
  
**Alternatives to Controlled Components listens for events handler**
## Why would we use a ternary operator?
**an alternative to the if...else statement, easier to right, cleaner code**

## Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:
  
  **x===y true: ?**
